To command the camera in the terminal I suggest to use the fswebcam package. To install:

`sudo apt install fswebcam`

To take an image with a certain resolution and hide the standard banner:

`fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner /images/image1.jpg`

To find the supported webcam resolutions:

`v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext`

You could also use ffmpeg to take images and video. To install:

`sudo apt install ffmpeg`

To take an image:

`ffmpeg -f v4l2 -video_size 1280x720 -i /dev/video0 -frames 1 out.jpg`

A more advanced alternative is mjpeg-streamer, which enables you to stream the camera in a browser. You can find a detailed tutorial how to set that up here.
